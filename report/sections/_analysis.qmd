# Methods
Our methodological approach so far has focused on building a reliable, consistent, and well-structured dataset suitable for investigating gender representation among top-charting artists. Because our research questions depend heavily on accurate temporal and categorical information, ensuring high data quality was a central priority in this phase.

1. Data Cleaning (Completed)
All cleaning steps were implemented in Python using pandas and are fully documented in our separate cleaning notebook. The main tasks completed include:
## Removal of duplicate tracks
Duplicate entries were identified using the `track_id` field. Removing these duplicates ensures that each row corresponds to a unique song and prevents inflated counts in subsequent analyses.
## Standardization of date formats
The `album_release_date` column originally contained mixed formats (full dates, partial years, or blanks).  
We standardized all entries to **YYYY-MM-DD** whenever possible and extracted a consistent **release_year** variable.
When no date information was available, `"N/A"` was inserted to clearly distinguish missingness. These tracks will be excluded from time-based analyses.
## Handling of missing values
Aside from release dates, missing values were limited and did not affect key analytical variables.  
All missingness was documented, and the dataset now contains no hidden or ambiguous gaps.
## Cleaning numeric and text fields
Columns such as `track_popularity` and `duration_ms` were checked for data-type consistency and corrected when necessary.  
Text fields (artist, track names and album names) were standardized to improve grouping and categorization.
## Verification of the final dataset
We performed final validation checks, confirming that:
- no duplicate tracks remain  
- data types are correct  
- missing values are limited and documented  

The cleaned dataset is stored in our GitHub repository as  
**`cleaned_final_dataset.csv`**.

# Preliminary Analysis
Based on the exploratory data analysis, several clear patterns emerged regarding gender representation across decades, genres, and popularity levels. The purpose of the preliminary analysis is to connect these initial findings to the statistical methods that will help confirm, quantify, or further investigate the observed trends. The methods outlined below were selected in response to the structure of the data and the behaviors identified during EDA.

1. Gender Representation Over Time
Our EDA revealed a consistent dominance of male artists across all decades, despite slight increases in female and mixed-gender representation in more recent years. Because these trends appear systematic, we plan to use statistical methods to formally test whether decade and gender are associated.

Planned methods:
- Cross-tabulation of gender × decade
- Chi-square test of independence to assess whether gender proportions differ significantly across decades
If expected frequencies are low for minority gender categories (e.g., non-binary), we will use Monte Carlo chi-square or Fisher-type alternatives

Rationale:
These methods allow us to determine whether the shift in representation seen visually is statistically meaningful rather than random variation.

2. Gender Differences Across Genres
The EDA showed that certain genres—especially Pop, Rock, and Hip-Hop—remain heavily dominated by male artists, whereas female and mixed-gender artists are more present in genres like Dance/Electronic and Latin. These patterns suggest possible structural differences across genres.

Planned methods:
- Gender × Genre cross-tabulation
- Chi-square test of independence to evaluate genre–gender association

Rationale:
Since both variables are categorical, chi-square is the most appropriate starting point to test whether observed patterns reflect statistically significant disparities in representation.

3. Popularity and Gender
Our EDA indicated that average track popularity is quite similar across genders, though small differences appear in certain decades. The variability across time suggests that popularity may depend not only on gender but also on release year.

Planned methods:
- Group comparison tests
- t-test or Mann–Whitney test (e.g., male vs. female)
- ANOVA (if comparing > 2 gender categories)

Regression modeling
Model structure: popularity ~ gender + release_year
Allows us to control for the strong time dependency identified during cleaning and correlation analysis

Rationale:
These methods will confirm whether the small differences seen visually are statistically meaningful and whether gender predicts popularity once time is accounted for.

4. Correlation and Numeric Relationships
The preliminary correlation matrix revealed weak or negligible correlations among numeric variables (track duration, release year, popularity). This suggests:
No risk of multicollinearity in simple regression models
No strong linear relationships that bias later analyses
Thus, regression models including release_year remain appropriate and statistically valid.

5. Summary of Preliminary Findings Informing the Model Choices
Based on EDA, we identified:
- Strong categorical patterns → appropriate for chi-square tests
- Subtle numeric differences → appropriate for t-tests, ANOVA, or non-parametric tests
- Temporal effects → regression models with year controls
- Weak correlations → simple, interpretable statistical models are sufficient
These observations ensure that the upcoming analyses will be grounded in data-driven reasoning and aligned with methodological best practices.
