# Methods
Our methodological approach so far has focused on building a reliable, consistent, and well-structured dataset suitable for investigating gender representation among top-charting artists. Because our research questions depend heavily on accurate temporal and categorical information, ensuring high data quality was a central priority in this phase.

1. Data Cleaning (Completed)
All cleaning steps were implemented in Python using pandas and are fully documented in our separate cleaning notebook. The main tasks completed include:

## Removal of duplicate tracks
Duplicate entries were identified using the `track_id` field. Removing these duplicates ensures that each row corresponds to a unique song and prevents inflated counts in subsequent analyses.

## Standardization of date formats
The `album_release_date` column originally contained mixed formats (full dates, partial years, or blanks).  
We standardized all entries to **YYYY-MM-DD** whenever possible and extracted a consistent **release_year** variable.
When no date information was available, `"N/A"` was inserted to clearly distinguish missingness. These tracks will be excluded from time-based analyses.

## Handling of missing values
Aside from release dates, missing values were limited and did not affect key analytical variables.  
All missingness was documented, and the dataset now contains no hidden or ambiguous gaps.

## Cleaning numeric and text fields
Columns such as `track_popularity` and `duration_ms` were checked for data-type consistency and corrected when necessary.  
Text fields (artist, track names and album names) were standardized to improve grouping and categorization.

## Creation of derived variables
Two new variables were added to support time-based analysis:
- **release_year** (numeric)
- **decade** (e.g., 1980, 1990, 2000)

These variables will enable long-term comparisons of gender representation across the chart history.

## Verification of the final dataset
We performed final validation checks, confirming that:
- no duplicate tracks remain  
- data types are correct  
- missing values are limited and documented  
- all new variables are correctly generated  

The cleaned dataset is stored in our GitHub repository as  
**`cleaned_final_dataset.csv`**.


2. Planned Exploratory Analysis
With the cleaned dataset finalized, the next phase involves conducting structured exploratory data analysis. Planned components include:
- summary statistics (counts, proportions, distributions)  
- visualizations of gender representation across decades  
- genre-level comparisons of gender categories  
- examination of popularity differences between gender groups  

These steps will help identify major trends and guide the choice of statistical methods for confirmatory analysis.

3. Statistical Approach (Planned)
Although modeling has not yet been performed, we have outlined the methodological strategy that will guide the later stages of the project.

##Gender Representation Over Time
To examine how gender proportions evolve across decades, we will use:
- line charts showing gender trends  
- grouped bar plots  

These descriptive methods will provide a clear view of long-term representation patterns.

## Gender Differences Across Genres
To assess whether gender representation varies by genre, we plan to use:
- cross-tabulations  
- appropriate statistical tests for associations (e.g., chi-square) if assumptions are met  

This will allow us to evaluate whether certain genres consistently favor or exclude certain gender groups.

## Popularity and Gender
To explore whether popularity differs by gender, we plan to consider:
- comparison tests (t-tests or non-parametric equivalents)  
- ANOVA if multiple groups are involved  
- simple regression models (popularity ~ gender + year) if appropriate  

These analyses will help quantify whether observed differences in popularity are statistically meaningful.

## Rationale
These methods were selected because they:
- align directly with our three research questions  
- are appropriate for categorical vs. numeric relationships  
- are standard and interpretable within social-science and music-industry contexts  
- can be adapted depending on sample sizes and assumption checks  

This staged approach ensures that our final analysis will be statistically sound, transparent, and well-justified.

# Analysis
At this stage, our analysis has focused on validating the cleaned dataset and ensuring that it is ready for deeper exploration.

## Initial Checks
Once the cleaned dataset was imported, we performed the following checks:
- confirmed the dataset dimensions  
- verified that all duplicate tracks were removed  
- ensured that missing values were limited and correctly labeled  
- validated the standardized date formats  
- confirmed correct creation of `release_year` and `decade` variables  

These checks confirm that the dataset is ready for accurate visualization and statistical analysis.

## Early Observations
Although full EDA has not yet been conducted, several early patterns emerged from initial inspections:
- The dataset spans multiple decades, enabling meaningful long-term comparisons.
- Numeric variables (e.g., popularity, duration) are clean and consistently formatted.
- Missing values are concentrated in the release-date column and will not affect non-temporal analyses.
- Text fields are standardized, making them reliable for grouping by genre or artist.

These observations indicate that the data-cleaning phase was successful and that the dataset is well-prepared for the next analytical steps.
