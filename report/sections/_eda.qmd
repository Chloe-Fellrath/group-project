## Univariate Analysis
In this step, each key variable is examined individually to understand its distribution, central tendency, and overall spread. This approach helps us identify important characteristics such as skewness, outliers, common categories, and temporal patterns.
By analyzing variables one at a time, we gain a clearer view of how each behaves independently before exploring relationships between them. For our project, we focus on four main variables—track_popularity, genre, gender, and release_year—as they form the foundation of our subsequent analyses.
Examining these variables separately allows us to highlight meaningful patterns, detect irregularities, and better justify the methodological choices we make in the later stages of the study.
```{python}
#| label: fig-loading_data
#| fig-cap: "Overview of the dataset"
##Loading the data set for an overview of the dataset
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns

sns.set_theme(style="whitegrid", context="notebook",
                palette="colorblind", font_scale=1.1")

df = pd.read_csv("cleaned_final_dataset.csv")

df.head()       # shows the first 5 rows of the dataset
df.tail()       # shows the 5 last rows preview
df.shape        # shows the dimension of the dataset
df.dtypes       # check the structure of the data
df.isna().sum() # check if there is some missing value (no missing values found)
```
Since the dataset is complete, we can proceed directly with feature-level analysis and explore patterns in musical characteristics.
## Overview of the key variables
To recall we have chosen 4 key variables that will help us through our analysis:
- track_popularity: integer
- genre: string
- gender: string
- release_year: integer

## Distribution Plots
### Distribution of popularity
```{python}
#| label: fig-popularity
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of the Popularity of tracks"
# Set publication-quality style
sns.set_theme(style="whitegrid", context="notebook",
              palette="colorblind", font_scale=1.1)
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
sns.histplot(df["track_popularity"], kde=True, bins=30)
plt.title("Distribution of track popularity scores")
plt.xlabel("Popularity")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.show()
```
The distribution of track popularity is noticeably right-skewed, as shown in the histogram. Although our dataset focuses on songs that were considered popular (Billboard Hot year-end charts) from the 1960s to today, many tracks now receive very low popularity scores (between 0 and 10).
This pattern reflects how Spotify calculates popularity: it is not based on historical success, but on current listening activity. As a result, older tracks that were once widely recognized may no longer be frequently streamed, leading to low popularity values today.
This skewness highlights an important limitation of the variable: popularity on Spotify captures present-day relevance, not long-term cultural impact. This will be important to consider when interpreting trends over time or comparing older and newer releases.
### Distribution of genre
```{python}
#| label: fig-genre
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of Genre"
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("../data/processed/cleaned_final_dataset.csv")

def map_genre(genre):
    if pd.isna(genre) or str(genre).strip().lower() in ["n/a", "unknown", ""]:
        return None  # Remove unknowns
    if "rock" in genre:
        return "Rock"
    if "pop" in genre or "christmas" in genre:
        return "Pop"
    if "hip hop" in genre or "hip-hop" in genre or "rap" in genre:
        return "Hip-Hop/Rap"
    if "edm" in genre or "electronic" in genre or "electro" in genre or "new wave" in genre or "synth" in genre:
        return "Electronic/Synth"
    if "jazz" in genre or "motown" in genre or "northern soul" in genre or "new jack swing" in genre:
        return "Jazz"
    if "metal" in genre:
        return "Metal"
    if "folk" in genre or "country" in genre:
        return "Country"
    if "r&b" in genre or "soul" in genre or "doo-wop" in genre or "doowop" in genre:
        return "R&B/Soul"
    if "unknown" in genre:
        return "Unknown"
    return "Other"

# Apply grouping
df["genre_grouped"] = df["genre"].apply(map_genre)
# Count frequencies
genre_counts = df["genre_grouped"].value_counts()

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(genre_counts.index, genre_counts.values)   # shows the barplots
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha="right")
plt.title("Genre Distribution")
plt.xlabel("Genre")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
In this plot, all songs with unknown or ambiguous genres have been removed for clearer interpretation. We grouped all genres into the most frequent categories to better understand trends, excluding less common or unclassified genres.
The visualization highlights the most popular genres across decades, showing, for example, the prominence of Rock and the rise of Pop and Hip-Hop/Rap later on, offering interesting analysis insights to look into how music tastes have evolved over time.
### Distribution of gender
The gender distribution contains four categories: male, female, group, non-binary, and unknown. The male and female categories represent individual artists whose gender information is explicitly provided. The unknown category corresponds to missing or incomplete entries, which mainly come from inconsistencies in the MusicBrainz API.
This highlights a data limitation: gender information is not always available for every artist, especially older or less documented ones. The group category refers to musical groups or bands; these may consist of only men, only women, or mixed members. We chose not to classify groups further by internal composition, as this would require additional assumptions and introduce classification uncertainty.
Finally, the non-binary category represents a very small proportion of the dataset. This reflects both the relatively recent visibility of non-binary artists in mainstream music databases and the historical lack of representation in the industry. Overall, this distribution illustrates both structural biases in data collection and broader social dynamics within the music industry.
```{python}
#| label: fig-gender
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of Genders"
sns.set_theme(style="whitegrid", context="notebook",
              palette="colorblind", font_scale=1.1)
plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
sns.countplot(data=df, x="gender")
plt.title("Distribution of gender")
plt.xlabel("Gender category")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.show()
```
This missing gender information must be acknowledged because it affects the interpretation of all gender-related analyses. Any comparison between male, female, non-binary, and group artists will be biased if ‘unknown’ forms such a large segment.
For this reason, descriptive statistics and statistical tests should be conducted both including and excluding the ‘unknown’ category, depending on the research question.
```{python}
#| label: fig-gender-bi
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of Gender (Men and Women)"
# Filter only men and women
df_binary_gender = df[df["gender"].isin(["male", "female"])]

sns.set_theme(style="whitegrid", context="notebook",
              palette="colorblind", font_scale=1.1)

plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
sns.countplot(data=df_binary_gender, x="gender")
plt.title("Distribution of Gender (Men vs Women Solo Artists Only)")
plt.xlabel("Gender")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.show()
```
For this additional visualization @fig-gender-bi, we filtered the dataset to include only male and female solo-artists in order to observe the distribution between these two majority groups.
Entries labeled “unknown” or “non-binary” were excluded from this plot but are still considered in the global analysis.

###Distribution of the release year
```{python}
#| label: fig-release-year
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of Release Year"
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
sns.histplot(df["release_year"], bins=5)
plt.title("Distribution of release years")
plt.xlabel("Release year")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.show()
```
The distribution of release years shows a clear decline in the number of tracks originating from earlier decades, particularly from the 1960s to the early 1980s. Part of this decline is due to missing values introduced during our standardisation and cleaning process, where inconsistent or non-numeric year formats could not be reliably converted and therefore became “unknown” (represented as 0) in the dataset.
Additionally, Spotify’s API does not always provide a release year for older recordings, especially for tracks that were digitized, reissued, or remastered multiple times. In cases of remastered editions, the available release year may refer to the reissue date rather than the original publication year, creating additional uncertainty in the dataset.
Consequently, the temporal distribution should be interpreted with caution, as the representation of earlier decades is incomplete and may not accurately reflect the true musical output of those periods.
To facilitate clearer temporal analysis, we create a new variable grouping tracks by decade, which smooths out year-to-year inconsistencies.
```{python}
#| label: fig-release-year
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of Release Year by Decades"
##Distribution of decades
# Create decade variable from release_year
df["decade"] = (df["release_year"] // 10) * 10

# Convert to string labels (e.g., "1960s")
df["decade"] = df["decade"].astype(int).astype(str) + "s"

# Check distribution
df["decade"].value_counts().sort_index()

# Visualization of the plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
sns.countplot(data=df, x="decade", order=sorted(df["decade"].unique()))
plt.title("Distribution of Tracks by Decade")
plt.xlabel("Decade")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.show()
```

## Summary Statistics
The summary statistics provide an overview of our key variables. Numeric variables (release_year and popularity) reveal central tendencies, spread, skewness, and potential outliers.
Categorical variables (genre and gender) show the distribution of categories (see distribution above) and highlight the most common groups. Box plots and bar plots complement the statistics, making it easier to visualize distribution patterns and understand the dataset at a glance.
```{python}
#| label: tbl-summary-stats
#| tbl-cap: "Summary statistics for key Variables"
# Code visibility controlled by format settings in report.qmd

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("cleaned_final_dataset.csv")
key_vars = ["release_year", "genre", "gender", "popularity"]

for var in key_vars:
    print(f"\n=== Summary Statistics for {var} ===")

    if df[var].dtype in ["int64", "float64"]:
        # Numeric variables
        summary_stats = df[var].describe()
        print(summary_stats.to_string())
        print(f"Skewness: {df[var].skew():.3f}")
        print(f"Kurtosis: {df[var].kurtosis():.3f}")
    else:
        # Categorical variables
        counts = df[var].value_counts()
        print("\nCounts:")
        print(counts.to_string())
        print(f"Unique categories: {df[var].nunique()}")

# BOX PLOT FOR NUMERIC VARIABLES
numeric_vars = ["release_year", "popularity"]

for var in numeric_vars:
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 4))

    bp = ax.boxplot(df[var].dropna(), vert=True, patch_artist=True,
                    labels=[var],
                    boxprops=dict(facecolor='lightblue', edgecolor='black', linewidth=1.5),

# Bivariate Analysis

After examining each variable individually, we now explore how they relate to each other.  
In particular, we focus on:

- how gender representation changes across decades,  
- how gender is distributed across genres, and  
- how popularity varies across gender categories.

These relationships are central to our research question:  
**How has the diversity of artists evolved in top charts over time, and how is it reflected across genres and popularity levels?**
Our research focuses on relationships between:
- gender × decade
- gender × genre
- gender × popularity
- popularity × release year

These help evaluate how gender representation and popularity metrics evolve across time and musical categories.

## Gender Distribution Across Decades
```{python}
#| label: fig-gender-decade
#| fig-cap: "Gender distribution across decades"
df_decade_gender = df[df["gender"].isin(["male", "female", "non-binary"])]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
sns.countplot(
    data=df_decade_gender,
    x="decade",
    hue="gender",
    palette="colorblind"
)

plt.title("Gender Distribution Across Decades")
plt.xlabel("Decade")
plt.ylabel("Number of Tracks")
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.legend(title="Gender")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
Interpretation: As shown in @fig-gender-decade, gender representation in Billboard-charting tracks has changed substantially across decades. Male artists consistently dominate every decade, although the gap between male and female artists narrows noticeably starting in the 1980s. Female representation increases steadily from the 1980s onward, reaching its highest levels in the 2010s and 2020s.
Non-binary artists appear only in the most recent decades and remain extremely rare.

These patterns suggest that gender diversity in popular music has improved over time, but remains unequal.
The strong male dominance in earlier decades reflects historical industry barriers that limited female participation in mainstream music production and promotion.
The rise in female artists from the 1980s onward aligns with broader cultural and industry shifts—such as increased visibility, market demand, and improved professional opportunities for women.
The emergence of non-binary artists in the 2010s and 2020s likely reflects changing social norms, greater recognition of gender diversity, and improved availability of metadata documenting non-binary identities.

Implications for Our Research Questions
Has gender representation among charting artists become more diverse over time?
The increasing presence of female and non-binary artists supports the hypothesis that representation is improving, although the persistent male majority shpws that gender equality has not yet been achieved.

In the original dataset, a large number of artists had gender = "unknown" due to incomplete metadata from external sources. Including these entries would have made the chart difficult to interpret, because “Unknown” does not represent a gender category, but missing information. Its large size would artificially inflate some decades and hide real gender patterns. It would distort comparisons of gender proportions over time. Therefore, for this visualization, only male, female, and non-binary artists were included so that the plot accurately reflects trends among artists whose gender is known.

We will still acknowledge the presence of “unknown” in the limitations section, because missing gender information may bias the observed distribution.

## Gender Representation Across Top 10 Genres
```{python}
#| label: fig-gender-top-genres
#| fig-cap: "Gender Representation Across Top 10 Genres"
df_gender = df[df["gender"].isin(["male", "female", "non-binary"])]

df_gender = df_gender[df_gender["genre"] != "unknown"]

top_genres = df_gender["genre"].value_counts().head(10).index

df_top = df_gender[df_gender["genre"].isin(top_genres)]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
sns.countplot(data=df_top, x="genre", hue="gender", palette="colorblind")
plt.title("Gender Representation Across Top 10 Genres")
plt.xlabel("Genre")
plt.ylabel("Number of Tracks")
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.legend(title="Gender")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
Interpretation: As shown in @fig-gender-top-genres, the distribution of gender categories across the ten most frequent genres reveals clear patterns in representation. After removing the "unknown" category to avoid misleading proportions (because unknown entries come from missing metadata rather than meaningful gender categories), the visualization provides a cleaner and more interpretable picture of gender diversity in popular music genres.

Across nearly all top genres, male artists dominate, often making up the largest proportion of tracks within each genre.
Female artists appear consistently but in noticeably smaller numbers, and non-binary artists are extremely rare, appearing only in one or two genres with minimal counts. Some genres—such as pop and R&B—show a more balanced representation between male and female artists, while others—such as rap or rock—show a strong male majority.

The Story Behind the Pattern, these patterns reflect long-standing gender dynamics within the music industry:
- Male dominance in genres like rap and rock aligns with historical trends where these genres have been male-led spaces, often influenced by cultural norms and industry barriers.
- More balanced representation in pop and R&B suggests that these genres have traditionally offered more visibility and commercial opportunities for women.
The near absence of non-binary artists highlights both the recent recognition of non-binary identities and a lack of industry representation historically.

Understanding these disparities is essential for interpreting broader trends in artist visibility and chart success. If certain genres inherently skew male or female, then comparing gender representation without accounting for genre would give a distorted picture. This analysis shows that gender representation is genre-dependent, which we must consider in any follow-up statistical analyses—especially when examining popularity or career trends.

To make the analysis meaningful and avoid distortions, we restricted the visualization to the Top 10 most common genres in the dataset. Many genres outside the top 10 appear only a handful of times, which would introduce noise and make cross-gender comparisons unreliable. Additionally, we excluded the “unknown” genre category, since it reflects missing or incomplete metadata rather than a real musical classification. Removing these entries ensures that the chart focuses on genuine genre categories and provides a clearer, more interpretable picture of how gender representation varies across the most relevant segments of the dataset.

## Track Popularity by Gender Category
```{python}
#| label: fig-popularity-gender
#| fig-cap: "Track Popularity by Gender Category"
df_gender = df[df["gender"].isin(["male", "female", "non-binary"])]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
sns.boxplot(data=df_gender, x="gender", y="track_popularity", palette="colorblind")
plt.title("Track Popularity by Gender Category")
plt.xlabel("Gender")
plt.ylabel("Track Popularity (0–100)")
plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.4)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
Interpretation: As shown in @fig-popularity-gender, the boxplot compares the distribution of track popularity scores (0–100) across the three gender categories included in the cleaned dataset: female, male, and non-binary artists. The “unknown” category was excluded from this visualization because it reflects missing metadata rather than a meaningful gender group, and including it would prevent meaningful comparisons between actual artist categories.

Female and male artists display a wide range of popularity scores, with both groups showing tracks that span nearly the full 0–100 scale. Male artists exhibit the largest variability, with a notably lower median popularity compared to female artists. Female artists show a slightly higher median and a more compact upper distribution, indicating somewhat less dispersion. The non-binary category—although very small in sample size—shows distinctly higher popularity levels overall, with a tight concentration of values in the upper range (around 80–90) and only one visible outlier.

These patterns suggest that the male and female categories include a mix of both recent and older tracks, which contributes to their wider distributions. Spotify’s popularity metric is based on current streaming frequency, not historical success—so older songs naturally tend to have lower popularity scores. This likely explains the long lower tail observed for both male and female artists.
Non-binary artists, in contrast, are a relatively recent presence in mainstream charts, and therefore their tracks tend to be newer releases, which typically receive higher Spotify popularity scores. This explains both their higher median and their tight clustering at the top end. However, because the number of non-binary artists in the dataset is extremely small, these results should be interpreted cautiously—the high median may reflect the characteristics of only a few tracks rather than a generalizable pattern.

This visualization highlights an important methodological point: popularity trends cannot be interpreted independently of release year. Any statistical analysis comparing gender and popularity must account for the fact that non-binary tracks are more recent, and that male and female categories include songs across many decades.

## Average Track Popularity Across Decades
```{python}
#| label: fig-popularity-across-decades
#| fig-cap: "Average Track Popularity Across Decades"
df_clean = df[(df["gender"].isin(["male", "female", "non-binary"])) &
              (df["release_year"] >= 1900)]

if "decade" not in df_clean.columns:
    df_clean["decade"] = (df_clean["release_year"] // 10) * 10

decade_popularity = df_clean.groupby("decade")["track_popularity"].mean().reset_index()

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
sns.lineplot(data=decade_popularity, x="decade", y="track_popularity", marker="o")
plt.title("Average Track Popularity Across Decades")
plt.xlabel("Decade")
plt.ylabel("Average Popularity (0–100)")
plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.4)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
Interpretation: As shown in @fig-popularity-across-decades, the line plot displays the average Spotify popularity of Billboard-charting tracks across decades from 1950 to 2020. Before computing these averages, we removed implausible release years (e.g., 0–700 AD) to ensure that decade-level trends reflect genuine musical timelines rather than metadata errors.

The trend is highly non-linear. The 1950s show the highest average popularity (around 70), followed by a sharp decline through the 1960s and a steep drop reaching the lowest point in the 1970s (around 18). Popularity rises again in the 1980s, dips slightly in the 1990s and 2000s, and then increases strongly in the 2010s and 2020s, nearing the popularity levels observed in the 1950s.

This pattern does not reflect historical chart success—every track in this dataset was popular at the time of release. Instead, the trend is shaped by how Spotify’s popularity metric works: it measures current streaming activity, not past cultural relevance.
Thus, more recent tracks (2010s–2020s) naturally appear more popular because they remain part of active streaming behavior, whereas older tracks tend to receive fewer streams today, leading to lower popularity scores. The extremely low averages in the 1970s and 2000s likely reflect decades where many charting songs today no longer exhibit strong streaming traction.
The high average popularity in the 1950s is partly driven by the small sample size for that decade in our dataset (only a few tracks), making decade averages sensitive to individual values. This highlights the need to interpret early-decade values cautiously.

Therefore, this visualization shows that popularity cannot be compared across decades without controlling for release year. Such strong temporal bias means that any statistical analysis examining gender and popularity must include release_year (or decade) as a covariate. Ignoring this effect would lead to misleading conclusions, as differences might reflect temporal streaming patterns rather than gender-based disparities.

## Average Track Popularity by Gender Across Decades
```{python}

#| fig-cap: "Average Track Popularity by Gender Across Decades"
df_clean = df[(df["gender"].isin(["male", "female", "non-binary"])) &
              (df["release_year"] >= 1900)]

if "decade" not in df_clean.columns:
    df_clean["decade"] = (df_clean["release_year"] // 10) * 10

gender_decade_pop = (
    df_clean.groupby(["decade", "gender"])["track_popularity"]
    .mean()
    .reset_index()
)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
sns.lineplot(

)

plt.title("Average Track Popularity by Gender Across Decades")
plt.xlabel("Decade")
plt.ylabel("Average Track Popularity")
plt.grid(axis="y", linestyle="--", alpha=0.4)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
Interpretation: As shown in @fig-popularity-gender-decade, this visualization compares the average Spotify popularity of male, female, and non-binary artists across decades. Prior to computing these trends, we removed entries labeled as “unknown” gender, since this category reflects incomplete metadata rather than meaningful gender information. Including unknowns would obscure true cross-gender differences and make patterns uninterpretable.

Both male and female artists follow a broadly similar pattern over time: popularity peaks in early and late decades (1950s and 2020s), dips sharply in the 1970s, and gradually rises again after the 2000s. In most decades, female artists have slightly higher average popularity than male artists, particularly in the 1960s, 1980s, and 1990s.
Non-binary artists appear only in the 2010s and 2020s due to their much more recent documentation in streaming platforms. Their average popularity is very high in the 2010s (over 80) but decreases in the 2020s as the number of non-binary entries grows.

These decade-level trends are shaped largely by Spotify’s popularity metric, which captures current streaming activity rather than historical chart performance. Because more recent songs remain culturally active and receive more streams, all genders see higher popularity scores in the 2010s–2020s.
The consistently higher averages for female artists in several decades may reflect that a subset of female-led hits has maintained long-term relevance on streaming platforms—for example, iconic female pop artists tend to dominate nostalgic listening playlists.
For non-binary artists, the extremely high 2010s value is likely driven by very small sample size, meaning a single highly streamed artist can disproportionately raise the decade average. Their lower average in 2020 reflects the entrance of more non-binary artists into mainstream recognition, producing a more balanced mean.

This figure shows that popularity differences between genders cannot be interpreted without controlling for time. Without taking decade into account, any observed gender gap would actually reflect temporal streaming bias, not true popularity differences.
This could motivate our planned statistical analysis: future models will need to incorporate release_year (or decade) as a covariate when testing whether gender predicts popularity.

## Correlation Analysis (Numeric Variables)
- track_popularity
- duration_ms
- release_year
```{python}
#| label: fig-corr-matrix
#| fig-cap: "Correlation Analysis (Numeric Variables)"
numeric_df = df[["track_popularity", "duration_ms", "release_year"]]

corr = numeric_df.corr()

plt.figure(figsize=(7,6))
sns.heatmap(
    corr,
    annot=True,
    cmap="coolwarm",
    center=0,
    linewidths=0.5,
    fmt=".2f"
)
plt.title("Correlation Matrix of Numeric Variables", fontsize=14)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
Interpretation: As shown in @fig-corr-matrix, the correlation matrix displays the relationships among the three numeric variables included in our dataset: track_popularity, duration_ms, and release_year. The overall pattern reveals very weak correlations across all pairs of variables.

Track popularity vs. duration_ms:
The correlation is slightly negative (r = –0.06), indicating virtually no linear relationship between a song’s length and its popularity.

Track popularity vs. release_year:
A very small positive correlation (r = 0.05) suggests that newer tracks tend to be slightly more popular, but the effect is extremely weak and not meaningful.

Duration_ms vs. release_year:
A similarly small negative correlation (r = –0.07) shows almost no temporal trend in the average length of tracks.

These near-zero correlations indicate that none of these numeric variables strongly predict one another, which has several implications for our analysis:
- Popularity is not driven by track length, meaning duration does not confound popularity-based comparisons across gender or decades.
- Release year does not strongly correlate with popularity, reinforcing that Spotify’s popularity metric reflects current listening behavior, not historical success.
- The absence of strong linear relationships confirms that multicollinearity is not a concern for any regression models we may run later in the analysis.

As with earlier analyses, we removed entries with missing or invalid values (e.g., unknown genders or implausible release years) before computing these correlations to avoid introducing artificial distortions into the numeric relationships.

## Key Findings
1. As shown in @fig-gender-decade, male artists consistently appear more frequently in the Billboard top charts than female artists across nearly all decades. However, both male and female representation increase substantially beginning in the 1980s, with female representation nearly doubling between the 1980s and the 2010s. Non-binary representation emerges only in the 2010s and remains extremely limited.

Interpretation:
This pattern shows that gender diversity in popular music has improved over time but remains imbalanced. The rise in female representation aligns with broader social and industry shifts toward greater visibility and acceptance of women in commercial music. The late emergence of non-binary artists reflects both historical underrepresentation and the recent development of more inclusive gender categories in music databases.
This directly addresses our Research Question 1: How has the gender composition of charting artists evolved across decades?
The large disparities highlight long-term structural gender imbalances in the music industry.

2. Gender Diversity Varies Across Genres, with Strong Male Dominance in Most Categories
The distribution of gender across the top 10 most common genres (@fig-gender-top-genres) shows that most genres—especially hip hop and rock—are overwhelmingly male-dominated. Female representation is highest in pop, dance pop, and R&B. Non-binary representation remains nearly absent across all genres.

Interpretation:
Gender representation in top-charting music is strongly genre-dependent. Genres historically associated with industry gatekeeping (e.g., hip hop, rock) exhibit the lowest levels of gender diversity, while genres with broader mainstream crossover appeal (e.g., pop) show more balanced representation.
This finding addresses our Research Question 2: Does gender representation vary across musical genres?
The results suggest that gender disparities reflect genre-specific norms, production cultures, and commercial dynamics.

3. Track Popularity Differs Across Gender Categories
The boxplot in @fig-popularity-gender shows that female and male artists have broad and overlapping popularity distributions, while non-binary artists appear to have higher median popularity but also far fewer observations. Male tracks show a slightly wider spread, including more low-popularity values.

Interpretation:
Female and male artists perform similarly in terms of present-day Spotify popularity, with no substantial gap between their central tendencies. The elevated median for non-binary artists likely reflects small-sample bias, where a few highly-streamed tracks heavily influence the average.
This contributes to our Research Question 3: Are there measurable differences in popularity patterns across gender groups?
The results suggest that popularity disparities are minor and may require statistical testing (e.g., ANOVA or non-parametric tests) to confirm whether differences are meaningful (next steps).

4. Track Popularity Varies Substantially Across Decades
As depicted in @fig-popularity-across-decades, average track popularity fluctuates over time, with dips in the 1970s and early 2000s and higher values in the 1950s, 2010s, and 2020s.

Interpretation:
These differences reflect Spotify’s popularity metric, which captures current streaming activity rather than historical impact. Older songs must remain culturally relevant to maintain high popularity scores. Thus, decades with low averages (e.g., 1970s) may reflect generational turnover in streaming behavior rather than musical quality.
This highlights a key methodological limitation: popularity is not a stable historical measure. Any analysis involving popularity must consider that older tracks are structurally disadvantaged.

5. Popularity Trends by Gender Evolve Over Time
Figure @fig-popularity-gender-decade shows that both male and female artists follow similar popularity trends across decades, with lower popularity in the 1970s and early 2000s and sharp increases in recent years. Non-binary artists appear only in the last two decades, with high popularity values reflecting small sample size.

Interpretation:
Popularity differences across gender groups generally mirror decade-level patterns rather than diverging strongly within decades. This suggests that era effects —not gender—primarily drive popularity fluctuations.
This supports the idea that gender is not a major determinant of popularity once decade effects are accounted for. It also reinforces the need for multivariate testing in the Analysis section.

6. Numeric Variables Show No Meaningful Correlations
The correlation matrix in @fig-corr-matrix reveals near-zero correlations among track_popularity, duration_ms, and release_year.

Interpretation:
Track length does not predict popularity.
Release year has an extremely weak relationship with both popularity and song duration.
These weak correlations confirm that numeric variables pose no multicollinearity concerns for future modeling.
This supports the use of statistical methods that assume independence between predictors and informs variable selection for later regression or ANOVA models.
