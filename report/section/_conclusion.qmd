# Conclusion

## Summary

This project investigates how gender representation among artists featured in Billboard Top Charts has evolved over time, using track- and artist-level metadata retrieved through the Spotify API. Our research focuses on three main questions:  
(1) How has the proportion of male, female, and mixed-gender artists changed across decades?  
(2) Does gender representation vary across musical genres?  
(3) Are there measurable differences in popularity patterns across gender categories?

To prepare for this analysis, we completed a full data-cleaning pipeline. This included removing duplicate tracks, standardizing inconsistent release date formats, handling missing values, and creating new variables such as *release_year* and *decade*. 
These transformations ensure that the dataset—comprising more than 1,200 unique charting tracks—is consistent, interpretable, and suitable for time-based and categorical comparisons. 
Although the main exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical modeling will occur in the next project phase, the cleaned dataset is now fully ready for visual and quantitative exploration of gender diversity in popular music.

## Limitations

Several limitations affect our dataset and analysis:
First, Spotify does not directly provide gender information, requiring us to infer artist gender from external sources. This introduces potential misclassification, especially for collectives, mixed-gender groups, and nonbinary or gender-diverse artists who do not fit traditional categories. 
Second, release date precision varies: some tracks include full dates while others only list a year or lack a date entirely. We standardized formats where possible, but tracks labeled “N/A” cannot be used in time-based analyses. Additionally, Spotify genre classifications are algorithmic and sometimes inconsistent, which may influence cross-genre comparisons. 
Finally, our dataset focuses exclusively on Billboard charting songs, meaning our findings reflect commercial exposure and industry dynamics rather than the complete landscape of music production. These limitations do not undermine the analysis but define the context in which our conclusions must be interpreted.

## Future Work

The next phase of the project will involve several concrete steps to deepen the analysis:

- Conduct full exploratory data analysis (EDA), including descriptive statistics and visualizations that illustrate gender representation across time, genres, and popularity levels. This will allow us to identify key trends before running any statistical tests.
- Apply appropriate statistical methods based on insights from the EDA. Depending on the structure and distribution of the data, this may include tests for associations between categorical variables or models that examine whether popularity varies across gender categories over time. The final choice of methods will be determined after assessing sample sizes, group balance, and relevant statistical assumptions.
- Refine and validate our gender categorization, integrating additional external sources when necessary to reduce classification uncertainty—especially for groups and nonbinary artists.
- Consider expanding the dataset, either by incorporating additional chart sources (e.g., global Spotify charts) or by linking further metadata, which would improve the robustness and generalizability of our findings.

Together, these next steps will enable us to transform our cleaned dataset into a comprehensive and data-driven exploration of gender diversity in popular music.
