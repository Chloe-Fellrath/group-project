# Methods
Our methodological approach so far has focused on preparing a reliable and structured dataset for analysis. Since our research depends on accurately tracking gender representation across decades and genres, data quality was a central priority.

## 1. Data Cleaning (Completed)
All cleaning steps were implemented in Python using pandas and are fully documented in our separate cleaning notebook. The main tasks completed include:

### • Removal of duplicate tracks
Tracks with identical `track_id` values were removed to ensure that each entry in the dataset represents a unique song.

### • Standardization of date formats
`album_release_date` values contained inconsistent formats (e.g., “YYYY”, “YYYY-MM-DD”, blank entries).  
We standardized all entries to **YYYY-MM-DD** where possible and extracted the **release year** as a new field.

### • Handling of missing values
For tracks without any release date, `"N/A"` was inserted.  
These entries will later be excluded from analyses involving time trends.

### • Cleaning numeric and text fields
Columns such as `track_popularity` and `duration_ms` were cleaned and corrected to ensure consistent numeric formatting.  
Text fields (artist names and album names) were standardized to reduce inconsistencies.

### • Creation of new variables
We added:
- **release_year**  
- **decade** (e.g., 1980, 1990, 2000)
These new variables will allow us to analyze gender diversity across long-term trends.

### • Verification of the final dataset
We confirmed:
- correct number of rows/columns  
- no remaining duplicates  
- missing values limited to non-critical fields  
- proper data types  

The cleaned dataset is saved as **`cleanes_top_songs.csv`** in our GitHub repository.

## 2. Planned Exploratory Analysis

With the cleaned dataset finalized, our next step is to begin preliminary exploratory data analysis (EDA). Planned components include:

- summary statistics (counts, proportions, averages)  
- visualization of gender distribution over time  
- comparisons of gender representation across genres  
- exploration of popularity differences across gender categories  

These analyses will help us uncover major patterns before applying more advanced statistical techniques.

## 3. Statistical Approach (Planned)

Although statistical modeling has not yet been executed, we have defined the analytical strategy that will guide the next phase of our project.

### **1. Gender Representation Over Time**
To measure how gender distribution changes from decade to decade, we will use:

- proportion tables  
- grouped bar plots  
- line charts  

These descriptive methods align with our goal of understanding long-term representation trends.

### **2. Gender Differences Across Genres**
To assess whether gender representation depends on genre, we will use:

- cross-tabulations  
- chi-square tests of independence (if assumptions are satisfied)

This will let us evaluate whether genre categories are associated with uneven gender representation.

### **3. Popularity and Gender**
To investigate whether popularity differs by gender, we plan to use:

- t-tests or non-parametric alternatives  
- ANOVA (if multiple groups are compared)  
- regression models (popularity ~ gender + year)

These tests will help determine whether observed differences in popularity metrics are statistically meaningful.

### **Rationale**
We selected these methods because:

- they are appropriate for categorical vs. numerical variable interactions  
- they directly answer our research questions  
- they are standard and interpretable in social science research  
- they do not require assumptions that our dataset cannot meet  

This staged approach ensures that our analysis remains both rigorous and aligned with the structure of our cleaned dataset.

# Analysis

At this point in the project, our analysis focuses on validating the cleaned dataset and preparing it for deeper exploration.

## Initial Checks

Once the cleaned dataset was loaded, we conducted a series of checks:

- verified dataset dimensions (rows and columns)  
- confirmed that duplicate track IDs were fully removed  
- inspected remaining missing values  
- validated standardized date formats  
- ensured correct creation of `release_year` and `decade` variables  

These checks confirm that the dataset is ready for accurate visual and statistical analysis.

## Early Observations

While full EDA is planned next, we already observed:
- The dataset covers multiple decades of Billboard top charts.
- Numeric fields (e.g., popularity, duration) are properly formatted.
- Missing values are limited and largely restricted to release dates.
- Text fields are clean and can be used for grouping (e.g., by genre or artist).

These observations indicate that our cleaning stage successfully prepared the data for more advanced steps.
